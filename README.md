# ISTCollab

![project logo](app/assets/images/ist-collab-logo.png)

This project was designed and developed during the 2016 BreakingDev Hackathon, at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), and won the A+ challenge.

The goal for this project was to build a web platform targeted to IST students, to promote extra-curricular activities among them and open the communication between Alameda and Taguspark campus students. 

- Students can post *project* ideas and find colleagues with the same *interests* and necessary *skills* to collaborate with them. Additionally, students can create *organizations* that post *events* (e.g. hackathons, workshops...), in which other students can participate.
- Students, projects, events and organizations have profiles.
- Students can create an account and start using immediately the platform and have access to all students' profiles interested in collaborations.

A possible new functionality could be a private chat between students.
